## Executive Summary
**Objective:** Provide actionable insights into BMWâ€™s sales (2010â€“2024) for better decision-making in production, pricing, and marketing.

**Key Insights:**

* **Best year for revenue:** 2022 with $1.344 trillion USD earned.

* **Top region by units sold:** Asia with 42.97M cars (~17% global share).

* **Top model by revenue:** 7 Series contributing $1.79 trillion USD.

* **Hybrid/EV adoption:** Appears flat (~51%) in dataset, but real-world trends show strong acceleration in Europe & North America.




## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Visualizations & Insights

**1.Revenue by Year (2010â€“2024)**

  * 2022 was the peak revenue year ($1.344T).
  
  * Slight dip after 2022, potentially due to supply chain disruptions or EV competition.



**2.Sales Volume by Region**

  * Asia leads global unit sales (~17%).
  
  * Europe & North America remain strong markets.
  
  * South America & Middle East are smaller but promising growth regions.



3.Revenue by Model

  * 7 Series dominates with $1.79T lifetime revenue.
  
  * 5 Series & X models are also top contributors.
  
  * Niche models (M-series, i8) build brand prestige despite lower volume.



4.Fuel Type Trends

  * Dataset shows stable mix (~51% Hybrid/EV).
  
  * Real-world market indicates much faster EV adoption, especially in Europe & North America.



5.Transmission Trends

  * Automatic dominates, manuals are niche.
  
  * Manuals retained mostly in performance-focused models.



6.Color Preferences

  * Black, White, and Silver are consistently most popular.
  
  * Bold colors (Red, Blue) are limited but important for luxury/sports appeal.




## Business Recommendations
* **Focus on top performers** â€“ Prioritize stocking and promoting 7 Series & 5 Series in Asia and Europe.

* **Strengthen EV/Hybrid positioning** â€“ Expand marketing in Europe & North America where adoption is accelerating.

* **Improve data collection** â€“ Current dataset only covers annual totals. Collect monthly or transactional-level data for better demand forecasting.

* **Enhance customer insights** â€“ Link sales with customer demographics & feedback to refine product design (fuel type, engine size) and tailor regional campaigns.






## Tools

* **Python** â€“ Data cleaning & analysis

* **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data wrangling
